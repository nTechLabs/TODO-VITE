      atmosphere is composed primarily of nitrogen and oxygen, providing the
      necessary conditions for life. The planet surface is 71% water, making it
      unique in the solar system. Earth has a magnetic field that protects it
      from harmful solar radiation, and its orbit and axial tilt create seasons.
